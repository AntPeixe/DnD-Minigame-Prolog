# **DnD Minigame in Prolog**

This game was developed for a university assignment and it's main objective was to create a text base dungeon game in prolog.

The two .jpg files illustrate the map layout implemented for the game. The objective of the game is to find the golden key before you starve or die of thirst. There is also a store where you can sell items you pick for coins and buy food or water.
